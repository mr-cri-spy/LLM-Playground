# LLM Learning Playground

This is my personal space for learning, practicing, and experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs).
It’s not a production-ready project — it’s my sandbox where I explore concepts, write code, break things, fix them, and learn along the way.

# Why This Repo Exists

To practice working with LLMs in a hands on way from scratch
To understand how things like embeddings, RAG, and fine tuning actually work
To document my learning in simple words

To keep reusable code snippets for future projects

 Topics I’ll Explore

LLM basics with OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain

Prompt engineering & optimization

Embeddings & vector search (FAISS, ChromaDB)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Fine-tuning models on custom datasets

Agents & automation with LLMs

Evaluating LLM performance

 How I’m Keeping It Updated

Each experiment has:

A working notebook/script

A plain-English explanation in notes/

Learnings: what worked, what failed, what’s next

Regular commits with clear messages like:

feat: added FAISS-based RAG chatbot
fix: embedding dimension mismatch issue
docs: updated prompt engineering notes

# How to Try It Yourself

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/llm-playground.git
cd llm-playground


Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open any notebook in notebooks/ and run it.


 # About Me

I’m learning LLMs & Generative AI step by step and documenting everything so I can track my growth.
Think of this repo as my public learning diary.
